# Selenium

Selenium is an umbrella project encapsulating a variety of tools and libraries enabling web browser automation. Selenium specifically provides an infrastructure for the W3C WebDriver specification â€” a platform and language-neutral coding interface compatible with all major web browsers.

The project is made possible by volunteer contributors who've generously donated thousands of hours in code development and upkeep.

Selenium's source code is made available under the Apache 2.0 license.

## Internet Explorer Driver

- In order to run Browser tests, you first need to install the browser-specific drivers, such as [chrome driver]("https://chromedriver.chromium.org/"), [geckodriver]("https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases") or [edgedriver]("https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/").
  These need to be on your PATH.
